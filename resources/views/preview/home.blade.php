        <h2>Interneto Project</h2>
        <p>
            Interneto is a project to classify and categorize the internet, it has two main categories:
                <ul>
                    <li>Interneto links: one create a directory with related links to explore the interent in a better way.</li>
                    <li>Interneto manager: tool to create your own net, you can classiffy internet links but also local links.</li>
                </ul>    
        </p>

        <h4>Interneto comes from...</h4>
        <p>
            This idea comes from wanting to have a well-classified internet system available.

            When you set about the task, you realize that classification is a personal process, and that what really matters is the tool you use to classify the content and the system that you choose.

            The classification system is mainly defined by language if the word does not exist, there is no way to
            express that thought in that classification.
