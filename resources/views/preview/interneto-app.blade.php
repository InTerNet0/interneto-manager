            Interneto manager is a bookmark manager to store and save links from the internet and also from your local
            machine.

            The purpose is to permit the user to make a database of related links with valuable information to generate
            a knowledge system.

            Classify links is the best way to organize the information and make your own <span>innernet</span>. You can make your
            own databse with folders, tags, and rate of your links. Also you can search links via the type of content.

            <span>Pass from the Internet to your own InnerNet.</span>

            <span>Information</span> is just the <span>in</span>side <span>formation</span> with external data to create valuable knowledge.

            Interneto manager is a <i>self-hosted application</i> both in the cloud and locally that allows to categorize
            links from both internet and local routes. You should be able to export your database and view local or use
            it online in a remote server.
