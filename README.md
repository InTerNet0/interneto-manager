# Interneto manager

## Description
Interneto manager is a bookmark manager to store and save links of the internet.

The purpose is to permit the user to make a database of related links with information of saved links. You should be able to export your database and view local or use it online in a remote server.

Classify links is the best way to organize the information and make your own innernet. You can make your own databse with folders, tags, and rate of your links. Also you can search links via the type of content.

*Pass from the Internet to your own InnerNet.*

**Information** is just the **in**side **formation** with external data to create valuable knowledge.
